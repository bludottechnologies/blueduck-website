We retain profile, transaction and other information as long as a user maintains their Blue Duck account. Upon deletion of your account your data will either be deleted completely or anonymised, for example by aggregating with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning. Users can request deletion of their data via privacy@bludottechnologies.com. Following such requests, we delete all data which is not required for tax, regulatory, insurance and other legal requirements. In certain circumstances, we may be unable to delete a user’s account, for example if there is an unresolved claim or dispute. Upon resolution of the issue preventing deletion, we will delete the account as described above. We will also retain certain information if necessary, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention. For example, if an account is deactivated because of unsafe behaviour or fraudulent payments, we will retain information such as the e-mail address for that account to prevent that user from opening an account in the future. 2.7 Marketing and communication .

We will never sell, rent or lease your e-mail address or any other information to third parties for use in unsolicited messages or information. In the future we may sell, buy or merge with other businesses. In such transactions, we may include your information among the transferred assets. 2.8 Privacy Breach Policy .
