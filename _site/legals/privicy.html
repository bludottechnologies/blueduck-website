Tacking technologies used include cookies. Please see our Cookie Policy for more information on cookies and other similar technologies.</p> <p><strong>2.3 Data from other sources</strong></p> <p>We may receive data from any other sources. Should we receive any information about you from other sources, we will add it to the information we already have. Examples of types of information we could obtain includes updated payment information, customer support and credit and identity information, which we use to prevent fraud.</p> <p><strong>2.4 Data usage</strong></p> <p>We use your personal information to:</p> <ul> <li>Provide Blue Duck Alcohol Delivery services to you;</li> <li>Provide updates on delivery times;</li> <li>Respond to requests, comments or concerns;</li> <li>Notify you of changes or updates to Blue Duck;</li> <li>Provide you with special offers and other information about related products or services, including invitations to participate in competitions, surveys and promotions, as determined by your communication preferences;</li> <li>Evaluate and improve Blue Duck and to develop new products and services;</li> <li>Identify and analyse usage trends and determine effectiveness of promotional campaigns;</li> <li>Provide technical and other support and keep Blue Duck safe and secure;</li> <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li> </ul> <p>Any use of personal information other than those outlined in this policy will require your express consent.</p> <p><strong>2.5 Sharing/Third Parties</strong></p> <p>In order to provide delivery services, we provide the fulfilment centre with the full name, delivery address, e-mail address and phone number of the user once an order is placed. In order to protect this data, the fulfilment centre and its employees commit to acting according to their duty of confidentiality.</p> <p>By using Blue Duck, you agree to your payment details being shared with Adyen, which processes each payment. Adyen receives your name, payment details and e-mail address, through which we send a receipt of purchase and organise refunds.</p> <p>We host and maintain Blue Duck using AWS as our data hosting centre.</p> <p>Where we use providers based in the US, we transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en">European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</a></p> <p><strong>2.6 Data retention and deletion</strong></p> <p>We retain profile, transaction and other information as long as a user maintains their Blue Duck account. Upon deletion of your account your data will either be deleted completely or anonymised, for example by aggregating with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning.</p> <p>Users can request deletion of their data via privacy@bludottechnologies.com. Following such requests, we delete all data which is not required for tax, regulatory, insurance and other legal requirements. In certain circumstances, we may be unable to delete a user’s account, for example if there is an unresolved claim or dispute. Upon resolution of the issue preventing deletion, we will delete the account as described above.</p> <p>We will also retain certain information if necessary, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention. For example, if an account is deactivated because of unsafe behaviour or fraudulent payments, we will retain information such as the e-mail address for that account to prevent that user from opening an account in the future.</p> <p><strong>2.7 Marketing and communication</strong></p> <p>When you send us an e-mail, we use your e-mail address to respond and will store the communication for any future correspondence. When you accept to receive information about our services, we use your e-mail address to provide you with the information, until you ask us to stop via the unsubscribe instructions provided with each e-mail communication.</p> <p>If you consent to push notifications you will receive updates on order progress and delivery schedules in addition to special offers, we feel are relevant to you. You can opt out of these notifications at any time by altering the settings on your phone, however it will reduce the functionality of the App. This also applies to opting out of providing location data.</p> <p>In some cases, we may need to send you ‘transactional e-mails’ relating to normal business operations for example, to inform you of payment errors or refunds. You cannot opt out of these emails.</p> <p>We will never sell, rent or lease your e-mail address or any other information to third parties for use in unsolicited messages or information.</p> <p>In the future we may sell, buy or merge with other businesses. In such transactions, we may include your information among the transferred assets.</p> <p><strong>2.8 Privacy Breach Policy</strong></p> <p>The appropriate security measures have been put in place to prevent breach of personal data from being lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way. Access is only granted to your personal data upon genuine need and any use of it by us or our partners is subject to the duty of confidentiality.</p> <p>We also have measures in place to deal with a suspected security breach which can be viewed here.
